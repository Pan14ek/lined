# Lined  
**Where life and quality time meet.**

## 🌟 Description
**Lined** is an app for couples, families, and friends that helps synchronize schedules, coordinate tasks, and find shared quality time.  

The goal of Lined is to turn schedule chaos into harmony: you instantly see when plans overlap, plan meals or activities together, and delegate household tasks — all in one place.

## 🚀 Core Features (MVP)
- 👥 **Lobby** — create a shared group (couple, family, or friends).  
- 📅 **Calendar** — add personal and shared events, view overlaps in schedules.  
- ⏰ **Free Slots** — automatic highlighting of time when all members are available.  
- 📝 **Tasks** — shared to-do list with assignees and statuses.  
- 🔔 **Notifications (basic)** — reminders for events and tasks.

## 🔮 Future Development

- Personal dashboards (today / week view).  

### Phase 2: Social & Fun
- In-lobby mini chat.  
- Gamification (badges for shared activities).

### Phase 3: Scaling
- Cross-platform (Web + iOS + Android).  
- Multiple lobbies per user (family, friends, colleagues).  
- Integrations with other services (Slack, Notion).  

### Phase 4: AI (long-term)
- Recommendations for shared leisure time (“you both have 2 free hours on Saturday — here are options”).  
- Automatic household task distribution.
